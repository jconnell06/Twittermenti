# Twittermenti
This app was created as a part of a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WsWAEMScldUQn8F/) I am taking (September 2020). 

The goal was to create an app which tells the user what the general sentiment around a phrase, handle, or hashtag on Twitter based on the last 100 tweets. 

Sentiment for each tweet is analyzed by training a CoreML algorithm to determine whether a line of text is "Positive", "Negative", or "Neutral". An aggregate sentiment score is then calculated and returned to the user (in the form of an emoji, of course).

## Lesson Objectives

* Twitter API via Swifter
* Train a machine learning algorithm via CoreML
